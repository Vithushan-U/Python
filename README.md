# Analysis on Farm Capital, Revenue, and Expenses in Ontario 

This Python-based analysis explores trends in farm capital, revenue, and expenses in Ontario using Statistics Canada’s census data (2001–2021), all visualized through bar charts. Key focus areas include:

- The number of farms reporting
- Comparisons of operating revenues and expenses
- Total farm capital

## Data Preperation and Tools Used

- **Data Cleaning:** Processed and filtered in Excel
- **Notebook Environment:** Google Colab
- **Visualization Library:** Seaborn

## Visualization 1: Number of Farms Reporting From 2001 to 2021
This first bar plot shows the number of farms reporting data, which is crucial for interpreting the dollar values of capital, revenue, and expenses accurately. By understanding the number of farms reporting relative to these financial figures, we can make more meaningful comparisons across years. As seen in the plot, the number of reporting farms remained relatively consistent over time, with a noticeable dip in 2021, where the numbers differ significantly across categories.

## Visualization 2: Comparing Farm Operating Revenue and Expenses in Ontario
With an understanding of the number of farms reporting each year, we can now compare the operating revenue and expenses reported by Ontario farms in 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021. The visualization below clearly shows that both revenue and expenses have increased over the years, with each rising at a similar pace. An interesting observation is that, despite the decreasing number of farms reporting their data (as shown in the previous visualization), both revenues and expenses continued to rise.

## Visualization 3: Total Farm Capital in Ontario
Now that we've examined the total revenue and expenses, we can turn our focus to analyzing total farm capital over the years. Total farm capital includes the value of land, machinery, equipment, livestock, and other assets. The following visualization illustrates the trend in total farm capital, which, like revenue and expenses, shows a consistent increase over time.

## Key Insights
Despite a decline in the number of reporting farms, farm revenue, expenses, and total capital have steadily increased. This suggests that while fewer farms operate, the sector remains financially strong.
